# PRD implementation audit — 29 October 2026
**Shipped after this audit:** the controlled demo clinic text workflow is now live at https://35.208.235.27.sslip.io/. Choose **Try a demo appointment**. It adds owned tasks, exact expiring approval, slot contention protection, saved mock receipts, reject/cancel and reload recovery. No inference key is needed for this flow. It remains a simulation; real appointments, voice, reminders and general autonomous planning are not complete. Core PR9 and UI PR10 remain draft/unmerged. Deployed executable source: `9123f2f`; exact evidence is in HANDOFF.md.

Source: root `PRD.md`, copied unchanged from the human's replacement PRD in the Python repository. Later human decisions select this OpenDuet fork, fully self-hosted threads/memory and the existing GCP VM. Those decisions replace the PRD's suggested Python runtime stack, not its workflow requirements. No document authorizes live transactions or clears a provider/channel gate.

## Baseline before this continuation

Public executable source `52821a4`, PR8. Verified: web chat; owned SQLite conversations/reviewed preferences; anonymous 24-hour sessions; key-filtered Meta/OpenRouter picker; free/capped-paid policies; duplicate-safe inference and daily attempt ledger; bounded native Meta public lookup, page-open/source metadata and India dates. This is a useful chat/research demo, not the PRD's action-agent MVP.

The separate Python repository has tested mock task/approval/audio fixtures. They are reference implementation evidence only and do not run in the OpenDuet public site. Upstream OpenDuet features behind its different Intelligence/worker/bootstrap are likewise not automatically part of the self-hosted entry.

This table distinguishes partial coverage from completion. The appointment implementation is not a measured voice MVP, generic autonomous planning engine, real clinic connection or complete Phase1 port.

## Implementation order

1. **Current slice:** durable controlled clinic demo, exact approval, mock receipt, cancellation/status/reload recovery, with the same public chat/research app retained. No provider key needed.
2. **Voice and role interchangeability:** independently typed STT/TTS/reasoning/reply roles; explicit upload consent and bounded media lifecycle; evaluate consented en/hi/ta samples. Add provider credentials only through private configuration when a concrete adapter is ready. Model access alone does not supply speech.
3. **General task tools and supported live clinic:** native/MCP manifests, owner grants, role-pinned plans, durable external operation/reconciliation ledger, real clinic/calendar access after explicit setup. Keep mocks in CI.
4. **Notifications:** SQL schedule/outbox, cancellable one-off/recurring reminders, quiet hours, delivery attempt/status semantics and an opted-in channel. A timestamp in a database is not a delivered reminder.
5. **Identity and lifecycle:** account recovery/linking, export/delete, retention/backup operations, operational observability before private household data or live account actions.
6. **Partner capabilities:** approved calendar/email, telephony, groceries/commerce, travel. WhatsApp/public rollout, IRCTC ticket issuance and payments retain the PRD's unresolved access/eligibility gates. No unofficial connector workaround.

Every slice needs an executable mock, boundary/ownership/error/restart tests and honest capability UI. No percentage-complete estimate is claimed: the remaining work includes partner access and evaluation, not merely coding effort.
